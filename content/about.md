Hello, dear Reader!

My name is Georg GÃ¶ring, a masters graduate in Computer Science.
Programming and by proxy the act of learning always has been a passion of mine as evidenced by a constant involvement in one of, if not the largest
programming discord servers with 40000+ members where I've been active as a moderator and as a helper primarily in java.
I'm also a member of a competent Java User Group called JUG Ostfalen which is active in the wider area of Brunswick and Wolfsburg both of which lie in Lower Saxony Germany.

After acquiring my degree the April of 2020, i've also started working on numerous side projects and hope to widen my technological horizon.

## JUG Ostfalen

Are you somewhere in the wider area of Brunswick and are an interested Java Developer?
Then visit the following link of the [JUG Ostfalen](https://www.jug-ostfalen.de/). A great source
of knowledge in the java ecosystem and a growing community that writes articles, holds regular talks
and workshops.

## Discord

Feel free to join [The Programmers Hangout](discord.gg/programming) one of the largest programming discord servers with 40000+ members.
Make sure to familiarize yourself with our rules when joining and I hope you have great time learning and chatting with everyone.

## Languages

I'm proficient in the java ecosystem including the enterprise edition api's, 
the spring framework which encompasses mainly Spring Boot and numerous starters associated with the spring initializr,
some light scripting with Groovy primarily in Jenkins Pipelines or Jenkins Pipeline Libraries and a small amount of kotlin.

## Databases

I've professionally worked with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle DB, DB2 LUW/zOS and Neo4j.
In my open source projects so far I've been trying out mongodb, sqlite, mariadb 
and plan to dip into a couple of other Database Systems.

## Hobbies

* Running
* Driving around with my Bicycle
* Archery
* Gaming (Boardgames, Pen&Paper, Digital)
* Programming (duh)
* Books, i guess?
